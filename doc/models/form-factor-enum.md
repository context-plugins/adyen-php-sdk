# Form Factor Enum

Business accounts with a `formFactor` value of **physical** are business accounts issued under the central bank of that country. The default value is **physical** for NL, US, and UK business accounts.

Adyen creates a local IBAN for business accounts when the `formFactor` value is set to **virtual**. The local IBANs that are supported are for DE and FR, which reference a physical NL account, with funds being routed through the central bank of NL.
